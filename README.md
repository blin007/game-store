## **Overview** 🕹️

### Expected behaviour

Users should be able to:

- Search any game
- View game descriptions and screenshots
- Login and add games to their cart
- Purchase games in their cart
- View their account's past purchases
- Browse an extensive library of games powered by [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

### What I learned

- I learned how to implement StripeJS, React Redux, Firebase, and Framer Motion into a React project.
- I learned how to use Firebase functions to create a Full-Stack application
- As of now, I am satisfied with the results of the project, but looking ahead, I would like to implement a "Loading" component that is rendered whenever an axios request is made
